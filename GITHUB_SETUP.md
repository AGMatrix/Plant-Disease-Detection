# GitHub Setup Instructions

Your code has been committed locally and is ready to push to GitHub!

## Steps to Push to GitHub:

### Option 1: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub** and sign in: https://github.com

2. **Create a new repository**:
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right
   - Select "New repository"
   - Repository name: `plant-disease-detection`
   - Description: "Plant disease detection system using DINOv2 vision transformer"
   - Choose **Public** or **Private**
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Copy the repository URL** that GitHub shows you. It will look like:
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/plant-disease-detection.git
   ```

4. **In your terminal**, run these commands (replace URL with yours):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/akankshagarg/Desktop/plant_disease_detection

   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/plant-disease-detection.git

   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **Enter your GitHub credentials** when prompted

6. **Done!** Your code is now on GitHub

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (If you install it)

1. Install GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install gh
   ```

2. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

3. Create repository and push:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/akankshagarg/Desktop/plant_disease_detection
   gh repo create plant-disease-detection --public --source=. --push
   ```

## What's Been Committed:

Your local git repository now contains:
- ✅ All source code files (7 Python files)
- ✅ requirements.txt (dependencies)
- ✅ README.md (comprehensive documentation)
- ✅ .gitignore (excludes data files, models, venv)

**Files NOT included** (by design):
- ❌ `venv/` - Virtual environment (too large, user-specific)
- ❌ `archive/` - Dataset (too large, privacy/license concerns)
- ❌ `*.pth` - Model weights (too large, can be regenerated)
- ❌ `*.csv` - Data splits (generated from dataset)
- ❌ `.idea/` - IDE settings (user-specific)

---

## After Pushing to GitHub:

### Add a Nice README Badge (Optional)
Add this to the top of your README.md:
```markdown
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)
![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-2.0+-red.svg)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)
```

### Consider Adding:
1. **Sample predictions** - Add a screenshots folder with examples
2. **Model checkpoint** - Upload trained model to GitHub Releases or Hugging Face
3. **Dataset link** - If using public dataset, link to it
4. **Demo video** - Record a quick demo of the web interface

---

## Troubleshooting:

### "Permission denied (publickey)"
- You need to set up SSH keys or use HTTPS with personal access token
- Use HTTPS URL: `https://github.com/username/repo.git`
- GitHub now requires personal access tokens instead of passwords

### "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work"
- If you accidentally initialized with README on GitHub:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
  git push -u origin main
  ```

### Need to change repository name?
```bash
git remote set-url origin NEW_GITHUB_URL
```
