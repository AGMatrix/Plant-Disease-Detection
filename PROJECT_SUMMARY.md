- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained on 142M images, fine-tuned for plant diseases
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Interface**: Gradio web UI
- **Training**: Stratified 70/15/15 train/val/test split

## What is DINOv2?

### Overview
**DINOv2** (Distillation with NO labels, version 2) is a state-of-the-art vision transformer model from Meta AI Research.

### Key Features:
- **Self-supervised learning**: Trained on 142 million images WITHOUT manual labels
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: Uses attention mechanisms instead of traditional convolutions
- **General-purpose**: Learns universal visual features applicable to many tasks
- **Transfer learning ready**: Pre-trained features work well on downstream tasks

### Why DINOv2 for This Project?
1. **Superior feature extraction**: Understands complex visual patterns, textures, and shapes
2. **No ImageNet bias**: Trained on broader, more diverse dataset
3. **Fine-grained discrimination**: Excellent at detecting subtle differences (crucial for disease symptoms)
4. **Efficient transfer learning**: Saves computational resources vs. training from scratch
5. **State-of-the-art performance**: Outperforms many traditional CNN architectures

### How It Works:
```

## Current Performance Issues

### Problem: Model Fails on New Black Rot Images

Despite high training accuracy, the model struggles with new images. This is **OVERFITTING**.

### Root Causes:

1. **Limited Data Augmentation**
   - Only horizontal flip and 15° rotation
   - Doesn't cover real-world variations (lighting, scale, background, color)

2. **Frozen Backbone**
   - DINOv2 features not adapted to plant diseases specifically
   - Only the small classification head learns disease patterns

3. **Training Data Memorization**
   - Model memorized specific training images
   - Didn't learn generalizable disease features

4. **No Test-Time Augmentation**
   - Predictions from single image view
   - Doesn't average over multiple perspectives

5. **Dataset Homogeneity**
   - Training images may be too similar (same lighting, background, camera)
   - Lacks diversity within each disease class

## Improvements Needed for Better Accuracy

### Priority 1: Enhanced Data Augmentation ⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: HIGH | **Effort**: LOW

Add to `train.py`:
```python
transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2, hue=0.1)
transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224, scale=(0.8, 1.0))
transforms.RandomAffine(degrees=15, translate=(0.1, 0.1), scale=(0.9, 1.1))
transforms.RandomApply([transforms.GaussianBlur(kernel_size=3)], p=0.3)
```

**Why**: Simulates real-world variations, prevents memorization

**Expected Improvement**: +5-10% on new images

---

### Priority 2: Two-Stage Training ⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: HIGH | **Effort**: MEDIUM

**Stage 1** (Already done): Train with frozen backbone
**Stage 2** (TODO): Fine-tune entire model with lower learning rate

```python
# Create new training script or modify existing
model = create_model(num_classes, freeze_backbone=False)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('best_model.pth'))

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam([
    {'params': model.backbone.parameters(), 'lr': 1e-5},  # Low LR for backbone
    {'params': model.classifier.parameters(), 'lr': 1e-3}  # Higher LR for head
])

train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, num_epochs=10)
```

**Why**: Adapts DINOv2 features specifically to plant disease patterns

**Expected Improvement**: +10-15% on new images

---

### Priority 3: Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) ⭐⭐
**Impact**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: LOW

Modify `predict.py`:
```python
def predict_with_tta(self, image_path, num_augmentations=5):
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB')
    predictions = []

    # Create augmentation pipeline
    tta_transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
        transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
        transforms.RandomRotation(10),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ])

    for _ in range(num_augmentations):
        img_tensor = tta_transform(image).unsqueeze(0).to(self.device)
        with torch.no_grad():
            output = self.model(img_tensor)
            predictions.append(F.softmax(output, dim=1))

    # Average predictions
    avg_pred = torch.mean(torch.stack(predictions), dim=0)[0]
    return avg_pred
```

**Why**: More robust predictions through ensemble of views

**Expected Improvement**: +3-5% confidence accuracy

---

### Priority 4: Learning Rate Scheduling ⭐⭐
**Impact**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: LOW

Add to `train.py`:
```python
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(
    optimizer, mode='max', factor=0.5, patience=3, verbose=True
)

# In training loop after validation
scheduler.step(val_acc)
```

**Why**: Prevents overshooting optimal weights, improves convergence

**Expected Improvement**: +2-5% validation accuracy

---

### Priority 5: Additional Advanced Techniques ⭐

1. **Mixup/CutMix Augmentation**
   - Mix two images during training
   - Forces model to learn features, not memorize

2. **Class Weighting**
   - Handle imbalanced datasets
   - Prevent bias toward common diseases

3. **Focal Loss**
   - Focus on hard-to-classify examples
   - Improve performance on confused classes

4. **Larger Model Variant**
   - Use DINOv2-large (1024-dim features)
   - Better capacity for complex patterns

5. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Train multiple models
   - Average predictions for robustness

6. **More Training Data**
   - Collect diverse samples (different cameras, lighting, backgrounds)
   - Critical for generalization
